  context: `
    <h3>Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822)</h3>
    <p>Shelley was one of the major English Romantic poets, alongside Byron and Keats. He was a political radical who believed in republicanism, atheism and the abolition of monarchy — views that scandalised early-19th-century Britain. He drowned in a sailing accident off the coast of Italy aged 29.</p>

    <h3>Composition and publication</h3>
    <p>"Ozymandias" was written in late 1817 and published in <em>The Examiner</em> on 11 January 1818. Shelley wrote it as part of a friendly sonnet competition with his friend <strong>Horace Smith</strong>, who wrote a poem on the same subject. Shelley\'s version is now world-famous; Smith\'s is largely forgotten.</p>

    <h3>The historical Ozymandias</h3>
    <p>"Ozymandias" is the Greek transliteration of "User-maat-Re", the throne name of <strong>Pharaoh Ramesses II</strong> (c.1303–1213 BCE), one of ancient Egypt\'s most powerful rulers. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus recorded an inscription on a colossal Ramesses statue: "King of Kings am I, Ozymandias. If anyone would know how great I am and where I lie, let him surpass any of my works." Shelley re-imagines this for the new Romantic age.</p>

    <h3>The British Museum statue</h3>
    <p>In 1816 the upper fragment of a colossal statue of Ramesses II — known as the "Younger Memnon" — arrived at the British Museum. Shelley almost certainly knew of it through newspaper reports. The poem grew partly out of the public excitement around the new acquisition, although Shelley never saw it in person before writing.</p>

    <h3>Politics</h3>
    <p>Shelley was writing during an age of European revolution. The poem is often read as an attack on tyranny in general — Napoleon had been defeated only two years earlier (1815). The point is universal: every empire eventually falls, and the only thing that survives the tyrant is the artist\'s record of him.</p>
  `,

  summary: `Lines 1–4: The speaker meets a traveller who tells him about a ruined statue in a far-off desert. All that remains are two enormous stone legs with no body — and, lying nearby in the sand, a broken, half-buried face.

Lines 5–8: The face shows a frown, a wrinkled lip and a "sneer of cold command". The unnamed sculptor understood his subject perfectly — the king\'s contemptuous passions are still visible, "stamped on" lifeless stone, although the king and his hand are long gone.

Lines 9–11: An inscription on the pedestal preserves the king\'s own boast: "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: / Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!" The intended meaning was that no rival ruler could ever match him.

Lines 12–14: But around the broken statue, "nothing beside remains". The "colossal Wreck" is surrounded by empty, endless desert. The sands "stretch far away" — the empire has vanished, and only the artist\'s record of the tyrant\'s sneer survives.

Overall meaning: A meditation on the impermanence of political power. Shelley uses the ruined boast of an Egyptian pharaoh to argue that all human empires end the same way. Time levels every tyrant; only art outlasts the ruler.`,

  formAndStructure: `Form: A 14-line sonnet, but a hybrid — Shelley borrows from both Petrarchan and Shakespearean traditions without obeying either. The rhyme scheme is unusual: ABABACDCEDEFEF. The half-rhymes ("stone / frown / command", "appear / despair") echo a building that is itself half-collapsed.

Frame narrative: The poem stages multiple layers of distance — Shelley\'s speaker hears from a traveller who saw a sculptor\'s rendering of a king\'s face, with the king\'s own words quoted from a pedestal. We are several voices removed from Ozymandias himself. This nesting makes the king feel small and far away.

Iambic pentameter: The metre is loosely iambic pentameter, but Shelley constantly disrupts it (e.g. "Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,"). The broken metre matches the broken statue.

Volta: The classic sonnet turn comes at line 12 — "Nothing beside remains." Three short, hammered words break the king\'s boast in half. After 11 lines describing the figure of authority, the poem\'s second half collapses everything in one sentence.

Caesura: Strong mid-line pauses ("Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,") slow the poem and force the reader to step from one image to the next. The most powerful caesura is the full stop in line 12, which breaks the boast forever.

Direct speech: The only direct speech belongs to Ozymandias himself — and it is the part of the poem that ironises hardest. By preserving the king\'s exact words, Shelley lets him destroy himself.

Closing image: Shelley ends with the long, drawn-out alliteration of "lone and level sands stretch far away." The line\'s metre lengthens and softens, mirroring the endless emptiness of the desert. The poem doesn\'t conclude — it dissolves.`,

      analysis:
        'The statue is introduced through what is missing — the body has gone, only the legs remain.

      analysis:
        'The pharaoh\'s face is broken but his contempt is still legible. The triadic list — "frown… wrinkled lip… sneer" — piles up signs of hostility. "Cold command" with its hard consonants gives the king a chilly, military authority. The face rules even after the kingdom has vanished.',

      analysis:
        '"Mocked" carries a brilliant double meaning: the sculptor\'s hand both mimicked (reproduced) and ridiculed (mocked) the king\'s passions. Either way, the artist outlives the ruler.
