  context: `<p><strong>Thomas Hardy (1840-1928)</strong> wrote this poem in <strong>1867</strong>, though it was not published until 1898 in <em>Wessex Poems</em>. It is one of his earliest poems and reflects personal experience of failed love.</p>
<p>Hardy is associated with <strong>pessimism and determinism</strong> -- a worldview in which humans are subject to forces beyond their control, including the inevitable failure of love. His work often challenges the <strong>Victorian idealisation of romantic love</strong>.</p>
<p>The poem reflects Hardy's belief that love is inherently <strong>deceptive</strong> -- it promises joy but delivers suffering. This aligns with the broader <strong>late Victorian disillusionment</strong> with Romantic ideals.</p>
<p>Hardy was also influenced by <strong>Darwin's theory of evolution</strong>, which suggested an indifferent universe with no divine plan. The "God-curst sun" reflects a world where nature is not benevolent but hostile or uncaring.</p>`,
  summary: `The speaker recalls standing by a pond on a winter day with a former lover. The landscape is drained of colour -- a white sun, grey leaves, starving ground. Everything reflects the lifelessness of their dying relationship.\n\nThe lover's eyes wander with disinterest. Empty words pass between them. The lover's smile is described as "the deadest thing" -- a devastating oxymoron that captures performed affection masking genuine bitterness.\n\nIn the final stanza, the speaker reflects on what this experience taught them: that love deceives and causes pain. The poem returns to its opening images -- face, sun, tree, pond -- showing the speaker is trapped in a cycle of painful memory with no escape or resolution.`,
  formAndStructure: `Form: Four quatrains (four-line stanzas) with a regular structure that creates an appearance of order and control, belying the emotional devastation within.\n\nRhyme scheme: ABBA -- the enclosed/envelope rhyme scheme mirrors the poem's cyclical structure and the speaker's sense of entrapment. The first and last lines of each stanza rhyme, creating a closed, inescapable pattern.\n\nCyclical structure: The final stanza returns to the images of the first (pond, sun, tree, leaves), showing the speaker is trapped in a loop of painful memory. No progress or healing has occurred.\n\nColour palette: The poem is deliberately drained of colour -- white, grey, neutral. The "neutral tones" of the title refer both to the emotional flatness and the visual bleakness.\n\nTemporal structure: Stanzas 1-3 describe the past event; stanza 4 shifts to the present, showing the lasting psychological damage.\n\nEllipsis: The trailing dots after "a-wing...." create an unfinished, haunting quality, suggesting the memory refuses to end cleanly.`,
  keyQuotes: [
    { quote: 'the sun was white, as though chidden of God', analysis: 'The sun is punished and drained of warmth. Hardy creates a world where even God is hostile, and nature offers no comfort. The religious language suggests cosmic disapproval.', themes: ['Pathetic fallacy', 'Religion', 'Bleakness'] },
    { quote: 'starving sod', analysis: 'Personification presents the earth itself as malnourished. The ground mirrors the emotional starvation of the relationship -- both are depleted and dying.', themes: ['Nature', 'Depletion', 'Suffering'] },
    { quote: 'fallen from an ash, and were gray', analysis: 'The ash tree pun suggests passion burned to ash. "Gray" -- the dominant colour -- represents emotional neutrality, the absence of both love and hate.', themes: ['Death of love', 'Neutrality', 'Wordplay'] },
    { quote: 'eyes that rove / Over tedious riddles', analysis: 'The lover\'s wandering eyes show disengagement. The speaker has become a "tedious riddle" -- something once intriguing now boring. Love has made familiarity breed contempt.', themes: ['Disillusionment', 'Boredom', 'Loss'] },
    { quote: 'The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing', analysis: 'The poem\'s most devastating line. An oxymoron -- a dead smile -- captures the horror of performed emotion when genuine feeling has died. The superlative "deadest" is absolute.', themes: ['Death imagery', 'Performance', 'Falseness'] },
    { quote: 'Alive enough to have strength to die', analysis: 'A paradox that captures love in its final moments -- still technically alive but with no purpose except to complete the process of dying. Grimly ironic.', themes: ['Paradox', 'Death of love', 'Irony'] },
    { quote: 'keen lessons that love deceives', analysis: 'Hardy\'s thesis: love is fundamentally deceptive. "Keen" means both sharp (painful) and eager -- the speaker has learned this lesson intensely and applies it universally.', themes: ['Pessimism', 'Deception', 'Disillusionment'] },
    { quote: 'And a pond edged with grayish leaves', analysis: 'The return to the opening image completes the cycle. "Grayish" slightly alters the original "gray" -- memory distorts even as it repeats. The speaker is trapped.', themes: ['Cyclical structure', 'Memory', 'Entrapment'] },

    { device: 'Oxymoron', example: 'The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing', effect: 'A smile (life) that is the "deadest thing" (death) captures the horror of false emotion. The contradiction forces the reader to confront the grotesque reality of performed affection.', lineRef: 10 },
